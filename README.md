# CSE 183_PROJECT_EMU MATCH

## Introduction
Thanks to stuff like emulators there are a lot of games people play that have online play but only through private room codes. This means there's no matchmaking and it'll be hard to find others to play with. The idea is that this website solves this, allowing people to "queue up" for these games and find others trying to play, then providing some kind of chat space for player to chat with each other.
### Matchingmaking
First is the actual matchmaking. Users, after signing up, can go to the "Games" section and queue up for a game. Here they will be taken to a waiting screen until a match is made. From there, users will be taken to a chatroom where they can discuss everything needed to get the match started. 
### Community
Second is the community feature. Users can join a global chat to discuss any topics that they are interested in and communicate with other users that also in the global chat.
